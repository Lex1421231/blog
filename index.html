                <h1>About me</h1>
                <br>
                <h2>My Story: Code, Bicycle, and a Loyal Friend</h2>
                <p>My name is Alexey, I'm 36 years old, and my life is a fascinating mix of programming logic, the speed
                    of bicycle wheels, and the boundless devotion of my dog Max.</p>
                <br>
                <h2>My Journey in IT</h2>
                <p>I earned a higher education degree, but my true passion awakened when I first encountered the world
                    of programming. I remember spending nights poring over HTML and CSS textbooks, getting frustrated
                    when layouts didn‚Äôt align, and feeling elated when my first scripts finally worked.
                    Now, web development and programming aren‚Äôt just a job‚Äîthey‚Äôre a way of thinking. I love that moment
                    when, after hours of debugging, the code finally runs flawlessly. I enjoy exploring new
                    technologies‚Äîright now, I‚Äôm diving deeper into React and Node.js. I also like helping
                    beginners‚Äîsometimes I write articles or answer questions on forums.</p>
                <br>
                <h2>Speed and Freedom: My Love for Cycling</h2>
                <p>When my eyes grow tired from staring at the screen, I hop on my bicycle‚Äîand instantly feel a surge of
                    energy. For me, it‚Äôs more than just a sport‚Äîit‚Äôs a way to experience freedom.
                    In the summer, I‚Äôve ridden through all of Moscow‚Äôs parks:
                    I love Sokolniki for its wide alleys
                    I adore Luzhniki for its views of the Moskva River
                    I often cycle around VDNKh, especially in the evenings
                    One day, I dream of embarking on a real cycling adventure‚Äîlike riding from Moscow to St. Petersburg.
                </p>
                <br>
                <h2>Max: My Warmest Connection to the World</h2>
                <p>But the greatest joy in my life is my dog Max. This golden-haired goofball with funny ears always
                    waits for me by the door, even if I‚Äôve only stepped out for five minutes.
                    We have special rituals:
                    Morning runs in the park (he needs to stay in shape due to his chicken allergy)
                    Evening playtime with his favorite worn-out toy
                    Our signature "cuddle time" on the couch after a tough day
                    Max is my stress reliever, my most loyal friend, and the best motivation to get up in the morning.
                </p>
                <br>
                <h2>Plans for the Future</h2>
                <p>Right now, I‚Äôm working on a few exciting projects:
                    Developing a cycling app with route tracking
                    Writing an educational blog about frontend development
                    Dreaming of building a smart doghouse for Max with an automatic feeder
                    But most importantly, I‚Äôm learning something new every day‚Äîwhether it‚Äôs another JavaScript framework
                    or the command "Give me your paw," which Max still stubbornly ignores.
                    P.S. If you ever spot a guy on a bicycle with a laptop in his backpack and a golden retriever on a
                    leash in the park‚Äîthat‚Äôs me, living my best life! üö¥‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüíªüêï</p>

                            I love going out to the forest.

                            is Max, and he‚Äôs my best friend. Max and I do everything together‚Äîwhen I eat or work, he
                            comes over and rests his head on my knee. We love going for walks together and visiting the
                            park, where he enjoys running around with other dogs and chewing on sticks. My dog Max has a
                            chicken allergy, so he has to eat special food, which makes him gain weight. I run with him
                            to keep him in shape.</p>

                        <h1>The Essentials of Markup. BEM (Block, Element, Modifier)</h1>
                        <p>The key to mastering layout is endless practice‚Äîyou must constantly learn new things and keep
                            practicing.
                            Experimentation is also important, but don‚Äôt forget the core principles.
                            One of these principles is BEM (Block, Element, Modifier), a methodology for creating
                            classes and subclasses. It‚Äôs a crucial part of web development that simplifies working with
                            websites.</p>
